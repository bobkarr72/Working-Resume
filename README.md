# Working Resume
A lone (template) copy of whatever working resume I'm intending to use when applying for work.

While the document is current & updated, the information is often removed/replaced with relevant work experience depending on upcoming submissions.  As mentioned in the .pdf, references are available upon request should you accidentally stumble across this thing and go, "Woah! Just what we're looking for!".
